Problem: 
    The impact of the increase of "Three True Outcomes" in Major League Baseball on fan attendance of games.

Background: 
    Baseball is America's pastime and people love it ... or do they? Throughout the past several seasons, Major League Baseball (MLB) (fan attendance has been decreasing) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2019/10/04/from-terrible-teams-to-rising-costs-and-more-why-mlb-attendance-has-been-down-over-7-since-2015/?sh=79f014c031a8]. There are a variety of factors for this, but considering baseball is a multi-billion dollar industry that has a significant influence on American culture, a decrease in attendance is relevant. *baseball brings in x money*

Research questions: 
    - What percentage of Plate Appearances have resulted in one of the TTO in 2012?
    - What percentage of Plate Appearances have resulted in one of the TTO in 2019?
    - How many fans have attended MLB games in 2012?
    - How many fans have attended MLB games in 2019?

Importance of the questions: 
    These questions are designed to search for a trend in the increase in TTO and a decrease in fan attendance. 2012 was picked as the first year for comparison because it is (the last time attendance increased from the previous year)[https://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article230089079.html]. And 2019 was chosen as the last year for comparison as it is the most recent "normal" season, in terms of fan attendance. The 2020 MLB season was severely shortened (60 games instead of 162) and also did not allow any fans to attend in the regular season, all due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 season has limited attendance, also due to COVID-19, which makes it an inaccurate comparison season too.
    For those reasons, the 2012 and 2019 years are also used as comparison dates to analyze the percentage of TTO plate appearances. These dates are compelling because (there are more walks, strikeouts, and home runs per game)[https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-growth-of-three-true-outcomes-from-usenet-joke-to-baseball-flashpoint/], especially home runs. It is particularly compelling to use recent years for these numbers because more people are becoming aware of the emergence of TTO since it was (coined in the late 1990's and early 2000's)[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three_True_Outcomes].

Datasets: 
    2019 Standard Batting (from Baseball Reference): https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2019.shtml#teams_standard_batting
    2012 Standard Batting (from Baseball Reference): https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2012.shtml#teams_standard_batting

Explanation of the data: 
    Each of these datasets shows the team batting totals for each MLB team (all 30 of them) in various statistics in that respective season. While this chart includes many columns, the only ones needed here are the columns labeled "PA", "HR", "BB", and "SO". These stand for "Plate Appearances", "Home Runs", "Base on Balls" (also known as a "Walk"), and "Strikeouts" respectively. We only need these 4 columns because the HR, BB, and SO are the 3 outcomes that make up the TTO, while the PA are the total of all TTO plus all non-TTO (anything else besides a home run, walk, or strikeout). The PA are needed because they allow the TTO to be seen as a percentage of all plate appearances, rather than raw totals, which makes it easier to compare between seasons. Side note: Plate Appearances are used rather than At Bats (AB) because the AB statistic does not include plate appearances that result in a hit by pitch, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, or most importantly, a walk. This makes the plate appearances the more relevant total statistic of all possible hitting outcomes.

Ethical concerns: 
    Hard to tell if TTO is what causes fan attendance to go down ...
